================= Presentation of the Photon project =================
The "Photon" Project is an open-source from-scratch Minecraft server. It takes over from CraftBukkit and Spigot, with all the benefits but without the drawbacks!
Benefits:
1. It is from-scratch and does not use any copyrighted code. Therefore there will never be any legal issue like Bukkit had.
2. It does not depends on Mojang's code. Therefore updates are quicker than the one of the projects that wrap the Mojang's code, for example Bukkit, Forge and Sponge.
3. It uses the latest Java version for better performance and smarter code.
4. It completely supports multithreading. It means that it uses several cores at the same time! This increases A LOT the overall performances.
5. It is designed for extensibility: different registries classes allow developpers to add and modify Blocks, Entities, Items, Recipes, Packets, etc...
6. It uses a "custom" map-format. Actually it is the format used by the game's protocol, therefore it's cleaner, smaller and faster than the default minecraft map format.

Goals:
1. Provide a fully multi-threaded server
2. Deliver blazing-fast performance while using less memory than CraftBukkit.
3. Allow developpers to modify as much things as possible.
4. Reassure servers admins: area protection is part of the Photon's core and cannot be bypassed by plugins. Same thing for permissions.
5. Be developper-friendly: classes and methods names are easy to understand, things are intuitive, there are a lot of extensible and utility classes provided.
6. Be noob-friendly: (almost) everything is well documented and explained. More and more languages are available.

Advices for plugins/mods devs:
1. Learn Java first!
2. Read the wiki then!
3. Read the documentation!
4. Write lightweight code!
5. Uses multi-threading to perform huge calculations or/and IO operations.
6. If you see a bug or have a suggestion: tell me!
7. Be happy =)

Advices for servers admins:
1. Read the wiki first!
2. Configure your server according to your needs!
3. Give (or not) rights to plugins by editing the Photon's security file!
4. If you see a bug or have a suggestion: tell me!
5. Enjoy =)
