# Photon-MC1.8
The photon project for minecraft version 1.8. Supports all 1.8 subversions: 1.8.1, 1.8.2, etc.

## Version discontinued
I'm now working on the 1.9 version only. While the 1.8 version began to work (ie it handles player's connection, moves and very basic chunk generation), I won't use it as a base for the 1.9 version. I'll do a proper work instead: one API, one implementation. And the API will be independant from the implementation. Photon will also get a new (much better) architecture.  
**The 1.8 discontinued version had no API, and does NOT implement the 1.9 API in any way**

## Instructions
If you still want to try this discontinued version, you'll see that some dependancies are missing. To fix the problem, download [my JSON library, version 1.1](https://github.com/TheElectronWill/JSON-javalib/tree/v1.1) and add it to the classpath.
